## Introduction

This project implements Clean Architecture with layers for application, domain, infrastructure, and presentation. It emphasizes Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control principles for a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Architecture Overview

The project is organized into the following layers:

1. **Application:** Contains application-specific business rules and orchestrates use cases.
2. **Domain:** Includes core business rules and entities.
3. **Infrastructure:** Deals with external concerns such as databases, APIs, and other frameworks.
4. **Presentation:** Manages user interfaces, input, and output.

The dependency rule ensures that dependencies only point inwards towards the core business rules, promoting testability and maintainability.

## Dependencies

List any external dependencies required to run the project, including libraries and frameworks. Provide instructions on how to install them.

## Getting Started
